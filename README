chess puzzle db
---------------

scraped from wtharvey.com, thanks!

pup[0] is required for processing the html

steps:

  wget -cr --convert-links http://www.wtharvey.com/index.html
  parallel ./process ::: www.wtharvey.com/*.html > tmp.txt
  awk -f process.awk < tmp.txt > chess-puzzles.txt

the awk script is not perfect, patches welcome
